### Databases

It takes more work to self-learn about database systems than it does with most other topics. It’s a relatively new (i.e. post 1970s) field of study with strong commercial incentives for ideas to stay behind closed doors. Additionally, many potentially excellent textbook authors have preferred to join or start companies instead.

Given the circumstances, we encourage self-learners to generally avoid textbooks and start with [recordings of CS 186](https://www.youtube.com/user/CS186Berkeley/videos), Joe Hellerstein’s databases course at Berkeley, and to progress to reading papers after.

One paper particularly worth mentioning for new students is “[Architecture of a Database System](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf)”, which uniquely provides a high-level view of how relational database management systems (RDBMS) work. This will serve as a useful skeleton for further study.

_Readings in Database Systems_, better known as [the databases “Red Book”](http://www.redbook.io/), is a collection of papers compiled and edited by Peter Bailis, Joe Hellerstein and Michael Stonebraker. For those who have progressed beyond the level of the CS 186 content, the Red Book should be your next stop.

If you're adamant about using an introductory textbook, we suggest _[Database Management Systems](https://smile.amazon.com/Database-Management-Systems-Raghu-Ramakrishnan/dp/0072465638/)_ by Ramakrishnan and Gehrke. For more advanced students, Jim Gray’s classic _[Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques](https://www.amazon.com/Transaction-Processing-Concepts-Techniques-Management/dp/1558601902)_ is worthwhile, but we don’t encourage using this as a first resource.

Finally, data modeling is a neglected and poorly taught aspect of working with databases. Our suggested book on the topic is _[Data and Reality: A Timeless Perspective on Perceiving and Managing Information in Our Imprecise World](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Reality-Perspective-Perceiving-Information/dp/1935504215)_.
