### Distributed Systems

As computers have increased in number, they have also _spread_. Whereas businesses would previously purchase larger and larger mainframes, it’s typical now for even very small applications to run across multiple machines. Distributed systems is the study of how to reason about the trade-offs involved in doing so.

Our suggested book for self-study is Martin Kleppmann's _[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://smile.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/)_. Far better than a traditional textbook, DDIA is a highly readable book designed for practitioners, which somehow avoids sacrificing depth or rigor.

For those seeking a more traditional text, or who would prefer one that’s available for free online, we suggest Maarten van Steen and Andrew Tanenbaum’s _[Distributed Systems, 3rd Edition](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/)_.

For those who prefer video, an excellent course with videos available online is [MIT’s 6.824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB), a graduate course taught by Robert Morris with readings available [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html).

No matter the choice of textbook or other secondary resources, study of distributed systems absolutely mandates reading papers. A good list is [here](http://dsrg.pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/), and we would highly encourage attending your local [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) chapter.
