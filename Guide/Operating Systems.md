### Operating Systems

_[Operating System Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118063333/)_ (the “Dinosaur book”) and _[Modern Operating Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013359162X/)_ are the “classic” books on operating systems. Both have attracted criticism for their lack of clarity and general student unfriendliness.

_Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ is a good alternative that’s [freely available online](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). We particularly like the structure and readability of the book, and feel that the exercises are worthwhile.

After OSTEP, we encourage you to explore the design decisions of specific operating systems, through “{OS name} Internals” style books such as _[Lion's commentary on Unix](https://www.amazon.com/Lions-Commentary-Unix-John/dp/1573980137/)_, _[The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Implementation-FreeBSD-Operating-System/dp/0321968972/)_, and _[Mac OS X Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Internals-Systems-Approach/dp/0321278542/)_. For Linux, we suggest Robert Love's fantastic [Linux Kernel Development](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Robert-Love/dp/0672329468).

A great way to consolidate your understanding of operating systems is to read the code of a small kernel and add features. One choice is [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html), a port of Unix V6 to ANSI C and x86, maintained for a course at MIT. OSTEP has an appendix of potential [xv6 labs](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-projects-xv6.pdf) full of great ideas for potential projects.
