### Languages and Compilers

Most programmers learn languages, whereas most computer scientists learn _about_ languages. This gives the computer scientist a distinct advantage over the programmer, even in the domain of programming! Their knowledge generalizes; they are able to understand the operation of a new language more deeply and quickly than those who have merely learned specific languages.

Our suggested introductory text is the excellent _[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)_ by Bob Nystrom, available for free online. It's well organized, highly entertaining, and well suited to those whose primary goal is simply to better understand their languages and language tools. We suggest taking the time to work through the whole thing, attempting whichever of the "challenges" sustain your interest.

A more traditional recommendation is _[Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools](https://smile.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811)_, commonly called “the Dragon Book”. Unfortunately, it’s not designed for self-study, but rather for instructors to pick out 1-2 semesters worth of topics for their courses.

If you elect to use the Dragon Book, it’s almost essential that you cherry-pick the topics, ideally with the help of a mentor. In fact, our suggested way to utilize the Dragon Book, if you so choose, is as a supplementary reference for a video lecture series. Our recommended one is [Alex Aiken’s, on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers).

> Don’t be a boilerplate programmer. Instead, build tools for users and other programmers. Take historical note of textile and steel industries: do you want to build machines and tools, or do you want to operate those machines?
