### Mathematics for Computer Science

In some ways, computer science is an overgrown branch of applied mathematics. While many software engineers try—and to varying degrees succeed—at ignoring this, we encourage you to embrace it with direct study. Doing so successfully will give you an enormous competitive advantage over those who don’t.

The most relevant area of math for CS is broadly called “discrete mathematics”, where “discrete” is the opposite of “continuous” and is loosely a collection of interesting applied math topics outside of calculus. Given the vague definition, it’s not meaningful to try to cover the entire breadth of “discrete mathematics”. A more realistic goal is to build a working understanding of logic, combinatorics and probability, set theory, graph theory, and a little of the number theory informing cryptography. Linear algebra is an additional worthwhile area of study, given its importance in computer graphics and machine learning.

Our suggested starting point for discrete mathematics is the set of [lecture notes by László Lovász](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/dmbook.ps). Professor Lovász did a good job of making the content approachable and intuitive, so this serves as a better starting point than more formal texts.

For a more advanced treatment, we suggest _[Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf)_, the book-length lecture notes for the MIT course of the same name. That course’s video lectures are also [freely available](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/), and are our recommended video lectures for discrete math.

For linear algebra, we suggest starting with the [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) video series, followed by Gilbert Strang’s [book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775/) and [video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/).
