### Computer Networking

Given that so much of software engineering is on web servers and clients, one of the most immediately valuable areas of computer science is computer networking. Our self-taught students who methodically study networking find that they finally understand terms, concepts and protocols they’d been surrounded by for years.

Our favorite book on the topic is _[Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://smile.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149/)_. The small projects and exercises in the book are well worth doing, and we particularly like the “Wireshark labs”, which they have [generously provided online](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/).

For those who prefer video lectures, we suggest Stanford’s [_Introduction to Computer Networking course_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWKsLVyf6cPwCLDIZnOj0NS) previously available via Stanford's MOOC platform Lagunita, but sadly now only available as unofficial playlists on Youtube.
