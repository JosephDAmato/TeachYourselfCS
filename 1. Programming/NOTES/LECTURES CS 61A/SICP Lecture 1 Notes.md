##### Functional Programming

Lecture starts off with a different library in scheme with some functions that I cant call in DR Racket.

I learned i can use the following to change language used in scheme. Use one at top of file 

```scheme
#lang sicp ; for book problems
#lang racket ; for class work
#lang scheme
```
