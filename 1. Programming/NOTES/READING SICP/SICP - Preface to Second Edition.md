## Notes
- Material of this book has been MITs intro CS since 1980
- ABOUT FOLLOWING THIS BOOK
	- h all the new material in the second edition, it will not be possible to cover everything in a single semester, so the instructor will have to pick and choose.
		- we sometimes skip the section on logic programming ([4.4](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4))
		- we have students use the register-machine simulator but we do not cover its implementation ([5.2](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/5_002e2.xhtml#g_t5_002e2))
		- and we give only a cursory overview of the compiler ([5.5](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/5_002e5.xhtml#g_t5_002e5))
