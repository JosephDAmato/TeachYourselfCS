## Notes
### 2.1 A Party
- Bunch of confusing puzzles and word problems and narration...bleh
- ways to sit at a table
- hand of bridge in a deck of cards
- combos of lottery numbers

### 2.2 Sets and the Like
- We want to formalize assertions like “the problem of counting the number of hands in bridge is essentially the same as the problem of counting tickets in the lottery”.
	- **Called a SET**
		- any collection of things (*elements*)
			- a deck of cards is **set** which the cards are the **elements**
			- Lets denote set w/ **P**
	- **Types of sets***
		- **R** : real numbers
		- **Q** : rational numbers
		- **Z** : integers
		- **Z**+non-negative integers
		- **N** : positive integers
		- **∅** : empty set
	- **DENOTING AND WRITING SETS**
	- If A is a set and B is an element we write
		- **b ∈ A**
		- number of elements in a set is *Cardinality*
		- denoted like this: |P| = 7
		- also: P = {Alice, Bob, Carl, Diane, Eve, Frank, George}
		- We can also use notation to clarify what numbers would appear in the set
			- {x ∈ Z : x ≥ 0}
				- *the set of integers contains x elements where x is greater than or equal to ZERO*
		- {x ∈ P : x is a girl} = {Alice, Diane, Eve}
			- denote this w/ G
		- D = {x ∈ P : x is over 21} = { Alice, Carl, Frank }
		- If an element within one set is also in another set we call that **SUBSET**
			- **A ⊆ B**
			- We allow that A consists of all elements of B (in which case A = B), or none of them (in which case A = ∅).
		- **INTERSECTION**
			-  **G ∩ D = {Alice}**
			- if nothing common: **DISJOINT**

## Exercises
 **2.3** 
 Name sets whose elements are (a) buildings, (b) people, (c) students, (d) trees, (e) numbers, (f) points.
 |a| = {}
 B = \{ x in Buildings} : x \{ is located in New York City} \}
 P = \{ x in  People } : x { is homo sapiens}
 Num ⊆ Z 
 
 **2.5**
  Name sets having cardinality (a) 52, (b) 13, (c) 32, (d) 100, (e) 90, (f) 2,000,000
  a: |Playing Cards| = 52
  b: |Bakers Dozen| = 13
  c: |Miles to work| = 32
  d: |Pennies in Dollar| = 100
  e: |Minutes in Soccer Game| = 90
  f: |Dollars I want| = 2,000,000   

**2.6** 
What are the elements of the following (admittedly peculiar) set: {Alice,{1}}?
An element called Alice and another SET containing 1

**2.7**
We have not written up all subset relations between various sets of numbers; for example, Z ⊆ R is also true. How many such relations can you find between the sets ∅,N,Z+,Z,Q,R?
N ⊆ Z
Z intersects N
Z+ intersects Z

**2.8**
Is an “element of a set” a special case of a “subset of a set”?

**2.9**
List all subsets of {0,1,3}. How many do you get?
{0}
{1}
{3}
{0,1}
{0, 3}
{1, 3}
{0, 1, 3}

**2.10** 
Define at least three sets, of which {Alice, Diane, Eve} is a subset
P, G, D
where:
P = {Alice, Bob, Carl, Diane, Eve, Frank, George}
G = {x ∈ P : x is a girl} = {Alice, Diane, Eve}
D = {x ∈ P : x is over 21} = { Alice, Carl, Frank }

**2.11**
List all subsets of {a, b, c, d,e}, containing a but not containing b.
{a} 
{a, c} {a, d} {a, e}
{a, c, d} {a, c ,e} {a, d, e}
{a, c, d, e}
