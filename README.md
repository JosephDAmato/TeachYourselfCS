## Teach Yourself Computer Science

---

This repository is a collection of _notes, assignments, & projects_ related to the the [TYCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) material. I hope this will be a jumping board to enticing recruiters, getting involved with projects, and showing proof of ability. I have not taken a normal route to learning and finding a career working in tech. The onus of proof is not merely that I know this, but to show how I did it on my ownâ€”especially since my path defies convention. When credentials are absent, clarity, rigor, and originality must speak louder.
